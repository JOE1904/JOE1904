## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Brick Blaster Game**: 
   - *Description:*
   - Brick Blaster is a classic arcade game that combines fast-paced action and strategic gameplay. In this timeless favorite, players take control of a paddle, using it to bounce a ball towards a formation of bricks at the top of the screen. The objective is simple: clear the screen of all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the bottom.
